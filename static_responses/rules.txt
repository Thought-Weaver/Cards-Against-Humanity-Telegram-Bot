To start the game, each player will draw 10 white cards.

The person who first joined the game begins as the Card Czar and will play a black card.

Each player then submits white cards using /play {card_id} to fill in the blank(s) on the black card.

Once all players have submitted their white cards, the Card Czar will choose the best white card submitted. That player will get one Awesome Point.

At the end of the round, the next person in the list will become the Card Czar.

The first person to 7 Awesome Points wins!
